In this folder, there are two subfolders:-

1) Embryonic datasets:
This folder contains BigWig files of 24-nt siRNAs from wild type and mutant embryo, floral bud and leaf datasets. Datasets from biological triplicates were pooled into a single BigWig file for convienence during genome browsing (FYI: Individual replicates can be found on NCBI GEO: GSE152971).

2) Public datasets:
This folder contains almost one hundred publicly available datasets analysed as part of this study to identify the uniqueness of the embryonic 24-nt sRNA population. These publicly available datasets were analyzed in the same way as the datasets generated from our lab and processed through the same nextflow pipeline and production of BigWig files.
